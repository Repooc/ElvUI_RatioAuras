# Ratio Minimap Auras (ElvUI Plugin)
Adds the ability to give your ElvUI Auras located by the minimap, separate width and height sizes.

Ever changed your ElvUI UnitFrame or Nameplate auras to have separate width and height (Disabling the Keep Aspect Ratio option) and wished your auras (buffs and debuffs) by the minimap would have a similar look to them as well?  Well this plugin does just that for you... Nothing more, nothing less.... The option is located in the Buffs and Debuffs section of the ElvUI configuration frame.  Under each section (Buffs/Debuffs) there is now a Size group with the new options.
